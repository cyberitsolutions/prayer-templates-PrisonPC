<h2><a name="Attach">To attach a file</a></h2>

<p>If you decide that you do not wish to attach any file, select  
the <i>Back to Compose Screen</i> button to return to the <i>Compose</i>
screen you came from.</p>

<p>To attach a file to your message type the name of the file in the
<i>File</i> box or use the <i>Browse...</i> button to select one.  
Once you have chosen the file, selecting the <i>Attach file</i> button 
will return you to the <i>Attach file</i> screen.
The name of the document, and its size and type will be listed.
For example:-</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td align="right">1.</td>
<td>Randomfile.pdf (15152 bytes) of type application/pdf</td>
<td><a href="#Attach">Detach</a></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p> This gives you the opportunity to cancel the attachment (by using the
<i>Detach</i> link by the file name) or to add further attachments.</p>

<p>Once you have finished selecting attachments you need to select the
<i>Back to Compose Screen</i> button to return to the main <i>Compose</i>
screen.  You will not see the file name there but the <i>Attachments</i>
button will change to show the number of files that will be sent as
attachments to your message</p>

<p> You can then continue to edit the message.  </p>
