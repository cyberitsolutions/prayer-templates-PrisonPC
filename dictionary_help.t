<p>Your <i>Personal Dictionary</i> is where you can build up a list
of words that you use that are not in the system dictionary used
by the spell checker.   Spelling is case sensitive.</p>

<h2><a name="List">Maintaining your dictionary</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Any words you have added to your personal dictionary appear,
    sorted alphabetically, above the fields for adding and removing
    words.  Words starting with a capital appear
    before those all in lower case.</li>
<li>To <i>Add</i> a word type it in the first field (as in the example
    "hypothetical" above) then select the <i>Add</i> button.</li>
<li>To <i>Remove</i> a word 
     <ul>
     <li>either type the word in the field by the <i>Remove</i>
         button and then select that button</li>
     <li> or select the relevant word in the listing.</li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li> <i>Back to Options Screen</i> returns you to the main <i>Account Management</i> screen,
and no changes are made to your dictionary.</li>
</ul>
