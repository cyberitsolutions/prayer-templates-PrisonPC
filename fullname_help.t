<p>User accounts are set up on Computing Service systems such as <% $g_service_name |h %>
using your registered name.  Your registered name consists of your
initials and surname, as this is the information that is kept in the
Computing Service's database.   This is also used to set an initial
default on another name field (in the Email system this is
called your <i>Fullname</i>).
Enquiries about your account will show both names.
It is not possible to change the registered name, but many people like to 
replace their initials in the other name field with their given name. 
This is the purpose of this, <i>Change Fullname</i>, option. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> <i>Fullname</i> is also, by default, the name that
appears in the <i>From:</i> field of an email.   It is possible to have
one name returned by an enquiry to your account, and another name used
on outgoing messages from Email.  If you wish to do this you will
also need to set your Email <i>Personal Name</i>  in 
<i>Manage -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Compose</i>.</p>

<p>When you enter the screen a check is made against <% $g_service_name |h %>
and the result shown as the <i>Current Fullname</i> entry.
To change your entry on <% $g_service_name |h %> enter the name you would 
like to appear in the <i>Fullname</i> field and then select the 
<i>Change Fullname</i> button.</p>

<p>The name that you choose should clearly identify you - using
just your first name is not likely to uniquely identify you.  Please bear
in mind that some "joke" names may be offensive to others. The local
database containing your real name is updated once every night.</p>
