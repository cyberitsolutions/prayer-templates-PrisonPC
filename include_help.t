<p>This option, reached from the <i>Import</i> button on the main
<i>Compose</i> screen, is suitable for plain text files that you
want to be included in the main body of the message.  Other files
(for example word processed documents or pictures) should be sent as
attachments.</p>

<p>Selecting <i>Back to Compose Screen</i> will take you 
back to the <i>Compose</i> screen you came from
and no file will be included in your message.</p>

<p>To include a file type the name of the file in the <i>File</i> box 
or use the <i>Browse...</i> button to select one.  Once you have chosen
the file, selecting the <i>Include</i> button will return you to the main
<i>Compose</i> screen, and the text of the file will be included in the
body of the message.  You can then continue to edit the message.  </p>
