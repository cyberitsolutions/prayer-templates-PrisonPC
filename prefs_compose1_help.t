<ul>
<li><i>Personal Name:</i> - this is what appears in the From: field of a
      message preceding your address. If, for example,
      your address is <tt>someone@somewhere.org</tt> and  you set
      <tt>Someone Else</tt> as your Personal Name then the From: field 
      in outgoing messages will appear as <br />
        <tt>Someone Else &lt;someone@somewhere.org&gt;</tt></li>
<li><i>From Address:</i> - this is what appears as your address in an
     outgoing message.  The default is shown on the screen.
     An address must be valid and it must belong to you.
    For example a valid alternative to <tt>sp999@cam.ac.uk</tt>
    would be <tt>sp999@hermes.cam.ac.uk</tt>.</li>
<li><i>Default Reply-To:</i> - By default replies will be sent
    to the address in the From: field of a message.  
    If you wish replies to be sent to another address, or addresses,
    then you can enter that address, or comma-separated list of
    addresses, in this field.</li>
<li><i>Signature:</i> - information that appears at the bottom of
       a message.  By convention this is 4 lines or less.  It is preceded
       by a separator line <tt>-- </tt>.  If you create a signature
       here then the separator line and signature are automatically included 
       in the text field in the Compose screen.</li>
</ul>
