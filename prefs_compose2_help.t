<ul>
<li><i>Use sent-mail folder</i> - when this is checked a copy of 
     all mail you send is saved to the mail folder you have
     named as your Sent Mail Folder.  The default is <tt>mail/sent-mail</tt>,
     the choice is set in the <i>Preferences --</i> screen.</li>
<li><i>Skip quoted text on spell check</i> - when this is enabled
      the spell check will ignore quoted lines which start with &lt;
      characters.</li>
<li><i>Line wrap on reply</i> - wraps the text of the message
    to which you are replying if, after inserting the quoting characters
     '<i>Line Wrap at:</i> below (default 76 characters).</li>
<li><i>Line wrap on spell check</i> - wraps the text of the message as part
     of the spell check action.</li>
<li><i>Line wrap on send</i> - wraps the text of the 
       message as part of the action of sending the message.</li>
<li><i>Enable manual line wrap options</i> - if this is enabled then 
      extra line wrapping options appear in the <i>Compose</i> screen.
      These can be used in conjunction with the automatic options
      above.</li>
<li><i>Line Wrap at:</i> - controls the number of characters (columns)
       which can appear in a line before the line is wrapped.
       Many people use an 80-character window, so 76 allows a good fit.</li>
<li><i>Compose window size</i> - controls the size of the text
       body area visible in the standard Compose screen. </li>
<li> <i>Spell Check language</i> controls which dictionary is used. 
     At present the only languages are <i>British English</i> and
     <i>American English</i>. The choice of which language affects
     several aspects, for example the use of
     -ise rather than -ize for words such as "itemise".  
    It is hoped that future releases will offer more languages.</li>
</ul>
