<ul>
<li><i>Use icons</i> controls the use of icons and text for
     links and navigation.
     If this option is unselected then only text is used.
     This has additional effects on certain pages.
      For example in the mail folder list screen the single column
      (envelope icon) that indicates 
      the status of a message is replaced by three columns
      <i>D</i> (marked if message deleted), <i>N</i> (showing
      <i>N</i> for a new message or <i>O</i> for a read message) 
      <i>A</i> (marked if message answered).
</li>
<li><i>Duplicate icons below message</i> controls whether a duplicate
      of the common toolbar (the icons/text appearing at the top
      of every screen) should appear below messages when they
     are being viewed.
</li>
<li><i>Default folder sort mode</i> affects the  way all mail folders are
    sorted and thus presented.  The default is <i>Arrival</i> - messages
    are presented in the order they arrive in the mail folder.  There is
    a wide range of alternatives, including <i>Date</i>, <i>From</i>
    and <i>Subject</i>. 
    It is also possible to change the sort order of the current folder in
    the <i>Mailboxes</i> screen. 
</li>
<li><i>Messages per page</i> controls the number of messages listed
    per screen in the message list screen.
</li>
<li><i>Addressbook sort mode</i> affects the way that the addressbook is
    sorted and thus presented.  The default is <i>Order</i> - entries are
    presented in the order they have been added to the addressbook.  There
    is a range of alternatives, including <i>Alias</i>, <i>Name</i> and
    <i>Comment</i> and <i>Address</i>.  It is also possible to change the
    current sort order on the <i>Addressbook</i> screen.
</li>
<li><i>Addressbook entries per page</i> controls the number of addresses
    listed per screen in the main addressbook screen.
</li>
</ul>
