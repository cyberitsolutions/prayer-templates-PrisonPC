<p>Once you have selected the <i>Reply</i> option for a message you need to
specify who is to receive the message.  This screen shows the original
sender and any other recipients of the message</p>

<h2>Reply Options</h2>

<ul>
<li><i>Reply to sender only</i> prepares a reply that will only
go to the original sender.</li>
<li><i>Reply to sender and all recipients</i> prepares a reply that will
place the name of the original sender in the <i>To:</i> field and 
the names of all other recipients in the <i>cc:</i> field.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the message has a <i>Reply-To:</i> header, this name will
appear as the <i>Sender</i> of the message.</p>
