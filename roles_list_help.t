<p>Roles are designed to handle cases where you need to
compose, reply to, or forward mail wearing another "hat",
for example as a webmaster or a member of a helpdesk team. 
Using Roles you can specify what will appear in the <i>From:</i>
and <i>Reply-To:</i> fields of a message and tailor 
the signature to the role.</p>

<p>Selecting <i>Add new role</i> brings up a role entry 
screen to allow the creation of a new role.</p>

<p> Once you have roles defined these will appear as a list of role names
(usually referred to as "aliases") after <i>Existing roles:</i>.  Selecting
a role name will bring up the roles entry screen to allow alterations to be
made to the entry for that role:-</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#Role">role1</a></li>
<li><a href="#Role">helpdesk</a></li>
<li><a href="#Role">role3</a></li>
</ol>
