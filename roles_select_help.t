<h2>Composing, Replying or Forwarding using Roles</h2>

<p>If you have defined one or more roles then, when you choose to compose,
reply to, or forward a message, you will enter this screen where you can
select the role that you wish to use by selecting the name of the role
(e.g. "helpdesk").  Choose <i>Default</i> if you do not wish to use one
of your defined roles.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen the role and selected the correct entry you will
enter the main <i>Compose</i> screen.</p>

<p><i>Cancel</i>  returns you to the Webmail page you came from.</p>
