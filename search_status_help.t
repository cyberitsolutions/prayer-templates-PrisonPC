<p>The Search screen allows you to select a set of messages from the
current mail folder using different criteria.  After you have selected your
messages you can take action on them, for example, <i>Mark</i> them all and
copy them all to the same folder.</p>

<p>After the initial search has been made it is possible to add another
criterion to refine the selection.</p>

<p>This form allows you to select messages by their status. 
These are </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Seen (read)</i></li>
<li><i>Unseen</i></li>
<li><i>Deleted</i></li>
<li><i>Not Deleted</i></li>
<li><i>Answered</i></li>
<li><i>Not Answered</i></li>
</ul>
