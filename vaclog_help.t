<p>The <i>Vacation Log</i> is associated with the use of a <i>Vacation
Message</i>.  It lists people who have been trying to contact you in your
absence (and also prevents duplicate messages being sent out).</p>

<h2>Log entries</h2>

<p>If you have a vacation message set up 
(or have had one and have not cleared the log) then
the names of people to whom the auto-reply has been sent will
be written to a log file.  If there are entries in the log file
then when you enter this screen it will look something like the
screen above. </p>

<p>Each entry has the date and time the auto-reply was sent.
The first entry for each person contains the name of the respondent 
and the subject of their mail.  Subsequent entries for the same person
note that the auto-reply has been previously sent (and hence has not
been sent again).</p>

<p>Each time you set up a new vacation message you need to clear
the existing log so that a copy of your new message can be sent
to people who have previously received the old message.  
Selecting the <i>Clear vacation log</i> button does this. </p>

<p>If there are no entries in your log then the message</p>
<blockquote>
No vacation log at this time
</blockquote>
<p>is displayed in place of the list of names.</p>
